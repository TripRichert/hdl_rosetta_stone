= hdl_rosetta_stone

I'm planning on putting a few examples in here in vhdl, verilog, and maybe some other languages.

Right now, this is primarily meant to help me remember some of this stuff, so I wouldn't recommend using this repo as a dependency.  If you need something out of here, fork the repo or copy the file and the license.
